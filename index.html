<li>I believe that 000webhost may be the better hosting platform for keeping information. 
  The real reasoning is that once we leave SVSU, our files will not be as easily accessed or deleted.
  000webhost in theory will still be there after graduation.
  However, I did like using the v-drive and csis server hosting better from a user standpoint, i felt they were easier to use compared to 000webhost. 
  This opinion may change as we do more programs in the class because what i think is better now is not justified by much besides how easy it was to use.
